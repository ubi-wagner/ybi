-- 134 · A rehearsal is not a signature, and the walk was calling it one
--
-- The landing page the year is closed from read **"9 CERTIFY · DONE ·
-- Signed by Tom Metzinger on 01 Oct 2026"** over a certification whose
-- `origin` is `REHEARSAL` — a signature a drive produced and no person
-- gave.
--
-- `122` exists for exactly this and gave the row the value that tells the
-- two apart; `v_rate_certified` carries `rehearsal` and has since that
-- migration. What `122` then found was that **six places composed their own
-- sentence** from `certified` and `certified_by`, so none of them could see
-- the new fact, and it fixed the six it knew about by sending them all
-- through `certification_lines()` — the one sentence-maker.
--
-- This is the seventh, and it is in SQL, which is why that sweep could not
-- reach it: a view cannot call a Python function. It is also the worst place
-- left to have it. Every paper `122` fixed says REHEARSAL on its face; the
-- walk is the screen that tells the controller the year is finished, and it
-- was telling him his own name was on the rate.
--
-- Two changes, and the second is the one that matters:
--
--   * the sentence names the rehearsal, in the words `certification_lines()`
--     already uses, because two spellings of one fact is how this started;
--   * **and the step reads OPEN rather than DONE.** A rehearsal is not a
--     weaker kind of done — nothing resting on it may go to a sponsor, which
--     is precisely the definition of outstanding. `086`: the step whose
--     whole job is to say what is unfinished must not assert that it is
--     finished.
--
-- Lifted from `132`, the definition in force. `070` records what retyping
-- one costs.
